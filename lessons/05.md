# Dijkstra's Algorithm

**Dijkstra's** finds the shortest path from a starting node to all other nodes in a graph with non-negative weights.

Steps:

1. Initialize distances: 0 for start, âˆž for others.
2. Use a priority queue to pick the closest unvisited node.
3. Update neighbor distances: `newDist = currentDist + edgeWeight`.
4. Repeat until all nodes visited.

Time Complexity: O((V + E) log V) with a binary heap.
