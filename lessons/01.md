# What is a Graph?

A **graph** is a way to model relationships between objects. It consists of:

- **Nodes (Vertices)**: Represent objects (e.g., cities, users).
- **Edges**: Connections between nodes (e.g., roads, friendships).

Graphs can be:

- **Directed**: Edges have a direction (A → B).
- **Undirected**: Edges have no direction (A — B).

> Example: A social network where each user is a node and friendships are undirected edges.
