# Weighted Graphs

In many scenarios, connections have different strengths or costs. A **weighted graph** assigns a number (weight) to each edge.

- **Positive Weights**: Common for distances or costs.
- **Negative Weights**: Can model credits or profits, but complicate certain algorithms.

> Example: Road distances between cities are positive weights.
