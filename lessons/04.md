# Shortest Path Algorithms Overview

Several algorithms find shortest paths:

1. **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: For non-negative weights.
2. **Bellman-Ford**: Handles negative weights, detects negative cycles.
3. **Floyd-Warshall**: All-pairs shortest path.
4. **A\***: Uses heuristics for faster searches.

Each has trade-offs in complexity and use-case.
